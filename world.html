                                On the edge of the civilization lies a mystical forest, an 
                                ocean made of green, that no man has ever set foot on. it is 
                                filled with creatures so ancient that no one has seen, plants 
                                so mystical that no one has heard.<br>
                                <br>
                                Once in a while, a stream of alienic light covers the entire 
                                forest, filling the entire forest with life and energy. No one 
                                know where the light come from, until...

                                However, there is some place in the forest where light 
                                can barely reach. In area like such, some more twisted 
                                and dangerous creatures gathered. Without any energy 
                                from the great light, they prey on anything with life 
                                within them.<br>
                                <br>
                                To those whose luck is awful enough to step into their 
                                territory, better be careful, or them shall pay greatly, if 
                                they ever have a forturne to escape.

                                The creature live inside the forest, they are neither 
                                animal nor plant. oddly, they are the combinition of both, 
                                with leaf like body to obtain energy from light and body 
                                parts to move, feed, or even... hunt and kill.<br>

                                some look like insects; some look like small mammals. 
                                No matter what, they crave the energy from the alienic 
                                light. Without any direct sources, those who pass 
                                through are perfect sources of energy. Of course, 
                                including YOU.
